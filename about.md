Welcome to my blog!

I had been vaguely thinking about starting a blog of some kind for some years now, but never did because I figured I didn't have much that was interesting to say.

As of about a month ago I started rolling up my proverbial sleeves getting serious with Rust.
There were a lot of questions I had that didn't seem to have good answers out there, so I figured I'd start up this blog to document any answers that I determined for myself.

So, most of the early articles here are probably going to be about Rust.
But I'm not limiting the scope -- if I do or make something that I think might be interesting to other people, I'll talk about it here.

I hope you find it informative, or at least somewhat useful :)
