Over the years I've come across a number of documents that I think are excellent, for various reasons.
Some deal with development, some deal with thinking, some deal with motivation, some deal with computers, some are just plain interesting.

This lists is mostly for myself so that I can find the links when referring someone to one of them, but you're welcome to peruse it yourself as well:
